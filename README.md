## Developing an AI application to classify Flower Specie
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to 
include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands 
of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using 
these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, we'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something 
like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower your camera is looking at. 
In practice we'd train this classifier,then export it for use in your application. 
We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

### Implementation
The project is implemented in python using pytorch. You can check the work in [this notebook](https://github.com/UsmanIjaz/Flower_Specie_Classification/blob/master/Image%20Classifier%20Project.ipynb).
